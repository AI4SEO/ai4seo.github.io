                improve it,<br> without you having to do anything?<br>
                Glad you came by, because that's exactly what we're doing or our AI to be exact. Sounds like magic?
                It's
                not!

            <h3>Here's how we did it</h3>
            <div class="article">
                <p>
                    As you might know most of your website's sourcecode is publicly readable for anyone. So is for our
                    AI
                    when
                    you
                    tell us an URL. Therefore we took SEO analysis to
                    the next step as our AI will also improve your ranking.
                </p>
                <img src="Instruction.svg">
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <img src="SEO.svg">
                <p>
                    You might have used SEO analysis tools in the past. The first step works pretty much the
                    same way. We'll have a crawler go through the code and check for topics to improve.
                    We'll then display the results in a nice manner so that you can see what to improve on and what's
                    more
                    important and
                    what's not.
                    Now step two seems like magic as we are actually generating search engine
                    optimized code for you.
                    However all we do is intelligently produce content, translate it to code and give it back to you.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <p>
                    Here is an example. Say you have provided an URL for us, we crawled through your website and found
                    that
                    one
                    of the improvable topics was missing alternative texts for images.
                    In order to improve on that our AI needs to know what's in the picture.
                    So
                    it will use a cognitive service for computer vision to check how similar images have been
                    categorized in the past.
                    As soon as it found out the most suitable category, it will check for trends and terms in that
                    field to
                    provide an high-quality alternative text
                    that effects your SEO score.
                </p>
                <img src="CognitiveServiceVision.svg">
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <img src="Handshake.svg">
                <p>
                    So far so good, we have related words for the image we want to describe. Now we need a sentence and
                    code to
                    embed. To accomplish that the AI will use another cognitve service to form the related words to
                    smooth
                    sentences and
                    put it
                    in the respective tags and attributes to provide the embeddable code that you want.
                    And that's it.
                    Have fun saving time and improving your SEO score by using our service!

                topics and provide a modified, optimized file that you can upload to your server. Choosing this
                approach will save even more time since you don't have to embed any code allowing you to improve your
                ranking even faster. A better ranking will generate more users and in the next step these users will
                enable you to increase your revenue.
